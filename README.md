# docker-bb-launchpad-CXP5.6-centos
Dockerfile that creates a functional version of BackBase launchpad CXP5.6 running on CentOS 6.x or 7.x. All dependencies are packaged in the same docker host so this is most targeted to development environments as good practices recommend that each process should be deployed in it's own docker container.

Note: Running this docker file requires access to a Backbase portal software which requires a license.
